- ✅ Set custom bet durations (minimum 5 minutes)
- ✅ Quick duration buttons (5 min, 15 min, 1 hour)
- ✅ Set prediction and stake amount
- ✅ Validate minimum stake requirements
- ✅ Contract interaction for bet creation

### Bet Joining
- ✅ Join existing bets with stake amount
- ✅ Set prediction (Yes/No)
- ✅ Token approval before joining
- ✅ Balance validation before joining
- ✅ Contract interaction for bet joining

### Bet Resolution
- ✅ Submit resolution for expired bets
- ✅ Vote Yes/No on bet outcomes
- ✅ Finalize bet resolutions
- ✅ Contract interaction for resolution submission

## Blockchain Integration

### Contract Interactions
- ✅ Read bet details from blockchain
- ✅ Create bets on blockchain
- ✅ Join bets on blockchain
- ✅ Submit resolutions on blockchain
- ✅ Finalize resolutions on blockchain
- ✅ Gas estimation before transactions
- ✅ Transaction simulation for validation

### Wallet Integration

- ✅ Display wallet address
- ✅ Switch networks
- ✅ Detect wrong network
- ✅ Read wallet balance

## Timestamp Handling

### Timestamp Extraction
- ✅ Extract Unix timestamps from large contract numbers
- ✅ Multiple extraction methods for different number formats
- ✅ Validation of extracted timestamps
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for extraction failures

### Expiration Verification
- ✅ Direct contract-level expiration verification

- ✅ Comparison between local time and blockchain time

### Time Display
- ✅ Format date/time for display
- ✅ Calculate remaining time
- ✅ Show countdown for active bets
- ✅ Progress bar for time remaining
- ✅ Handle time zones correctly

## Error Handling

### Contract Errors
- ✅ "Bet is not expired yet" detection and handling
- ✅ "Already submitted" resolution detection
- ✅ Gas estimation errors
- ✅ Contract revert reason extraction
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

### Input Validation

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Timestamp Handling
- ⚠️ Contract may use a different time calculation than client-side
- ⚠️ Large embedded timestamps require special extraction
- ⚠️ Blockchain time can differ from local time

### Contract Limitations
- ⚠️ Gas estimation may fail for various reasons
- ⚠️ Bet expiration requires direct contract verification
- ⚠️ Resolution voting has contract-level validations

## Future Enhancements

- 🔲 Move code into dedicated components
- 🔲 Create separate hooks for betting functionality
- 🔲 Improve UI/UX for betting interactions
- 🔲 Add notifications for transaction status
- 🔲 Add analytics for bet participation
- 🔲 Implement proper toast notifications instead of alerts
